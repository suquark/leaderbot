    Generalized Davidson model.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data : dict
        A dictionary of data that is provided by
        :func:`leaderbot.data.load`.

    k_cov : int, default=0
        Determines the structure of covariance in the model based on the
        following values:

        * ``None``: this means no covariance is used in the model. Together
          with setting ``k_tie=0``, the original Davidson model is retrieved.
        * ``0``: this assumes covariance is a diagonal matrix.
        * positive integer: this assumes covariance is a diagonal plus
          low-rank matrix where the rank of low-rank approximation is
          ``k_cov``.

        See `Notes` below for further details.

    n_tie_factor : int, default=1
        Determines the rank of low-rank factor structure for modeling tie
        outcomes based on the following values:

        * ``0``: this assumes no low-rank factor model. Together with setting
          ``k_tie=0``, the original Davidson model is retrieved.
        * positive integer: this employs a low-rank structure for modeling tie
          outcomes with rank ``k_tie``.

        See `Notes` below for further details.

    Notes
    -----

    This class implements a generalization of the Davidson model based on [1]_,
    incorporating covariance and tie factor models.

    **Covariance Model:**

    This model utilizes a covariance matrix with diagonal plus low-rank
    structure of the form

    .. math::

        \\mathbf{\\Sigma} = \\mathbf{D} +
        \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{\\intercal},

    where

    * :math:`\\mathbf{\\Sigma}` is an :math:`m \\times m` symmetric positive
      semi-definite covariance matrix where :math:`m` is the number of
      agents (competitors).
    * :math:`\\mathbf{D}`: is an :math:`m \\times m` diagonal matrix with
      non-negative diagonals.
    * :math:`\\mathbf{\\Lambda}`: is a full-rank
      :math:`m \\times k_{\\mathrm{cov}}` matrix where
      :math:`k_{\\mathrm{cov}}` is given by the input parameter ``k_cov``.

    If ``k_cov=None``, the covariance matrix is not used in the model,
    retrieving the original Bradley-Terry model [2]_ (along with setting
    ``k_tie=0``). If ``k_cov=0``, the covariance model reduces to a diagonal
    matrix :math:`\\mathbf{D}`.

    **Tie Model:**

    Modeling tie in Davidson model introduces a threshold parameter
    :math:`\\eta`. In generalized Davidson model, threshold parameter is
    instead modeled by the additive low-rank structure of the form

    .. math::

        \\mathbf{H} = \\begin{cases}
            \\mathbf{G} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^{\\intercal} +
            \\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\mathbf{G}^{\\intercal},
            & 0< k_{\\mathrm{tie}} \\leq m \\\\
            \\eta \\mathbf{J} & k_{\\mathrm{tie}} = 0,
        \\end{cases}

    where

    * :math:`\\mathbf{H}` is an :math:`m \\times m` symmetric matrix where its
      elements represent pair-specific thresholds and :math:`m` is the number
      of agents (competitors).
    * :math:`\\mathbf{G}` is an :math:`m \\times k_{\\mathrm{tie}}` matrix of
      parameters of the full rank :math:`k_{\\mathrm{tie}}` given by the input
      argument ``k_tie``.
    * :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}` is an :math:`m \\times k_{\\mathrm{tie}}`
      orthonormal matrix of basis functions.
    * :math:`\\mathbf{J}` is an :math:`m \\times m` matrix of all ones.

    Setting ``k_tie = 0`` leads to a model with single tie threshold,
    retrieving the original Davidson model (along with setting
    ``k_cov=None``).

    A similar approach that also models tie outcomes is
    :class:`leaderbot.models.RaoKupper` model.

    **Best Practices for Setting Parameters:**

    The number of model parameters and training time scale with
    :math:`k_{\\mathrm{cov}}` and :math:`k_{\\mathrm{tie}}`. Depending on the
    dataset size, choosing too small or too large a value for these parameters
    can lead to under- or over-parameterization. In practice, moderate values
    of :math:`1 \\sim 10` often balance model fit, test accuracy, and training
    runtime efficiency.
